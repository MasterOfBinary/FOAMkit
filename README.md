# FOAMkit

*NOTE: this project has been archived because I don't have time to work on it.*

Project management for OpenFOAM.

1. Update `foamkitenv.sh` to fit your setup. It should be fairly well-commented.
2. Source `foamkitenv.sh` using the command `. /path/to/foamkitenv.sh`. (You likely want to put this line in your `.bashrc` file).
3. Run `foamkit` from the case directory (i.e. the directory with `SOURCE/` in it) and follow the instructions.

For an example of how to use FOAMkit, look at https://github.com/MasterOfBinary/OpenFOAM-2D-VAWT.
