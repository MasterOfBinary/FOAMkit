# FOAMkit

Project management for OpenFOAM.

1. Update `foamkitenv.sh` to fit your setup. It should be fairly well-commented.
2. Source `foamkitenv.sh` using the command `. /path/to/foamkitenv.sh`. (You likely want to put this line in your `.bashrc` file).
3. Run `foamkit` from the case directory (i.e. the directory with `SOURCE/` in it) and follow the instructions.
